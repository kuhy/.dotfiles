* How does it work?
  Every part of my system is configured using some [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] file. Each file contains textual
  description alongside code blocks containing the actual configuration. These code
  blocks can be [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][tangled]] (extracted) into the dotfiles at specified path using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel]].
  The whole setup requires only Emacs with default packages.

  Org files contain the following header arguments:
  - =:tangle file_path= which specifies the actual path to the dotfile
  - =:noweb tangle= to allow expansion of code block's references
  - =:comments yes= to tangle also comments
  - =:mkdirp yes= to allow creating parent directories for tangled files
  - =:tangle-mode (identity #o440)= to set permissions of tangled files

  Some files such as [[file:variables.org][variables.org]] and [[file:secrets.org][secrets.org]] contains code blocks which are shared
  between multiple Org files (these code blocks are annotated with =#+NAME: block_id=);
  because of that, multiple applications can share the same color scheme, etc.
  These files are included in other files using =#+INCLUDE: file_path= statements.
  Included source blocks are then referenced in code like this: =<<block_id>>=.
  To prevent tangling definitions of shared source blocks, the =:tangle no= option is used.
  Because of that, files which are including these shared files must use =#+OPTIONS: prop:t=;
  this ensures that custom properties (like =:tangle no=) are also included in destination files.

  File [[file:secrets.org][secrets.org]] contains some sensitive data, therefore content of this file is encrypted
  using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Crypt.html][Org Crypt]] (headers are annotated with =:crypt:= tag).

  Unfortunately, built-in function =org-babel-tangle= which is responsible for tangling, does not
  work correctly with =#+INCLUDE= statements and encrypted files. Because of that, I created a
  [[file:system/scripts.org][simple script]] which overcomes those shortcomings.
