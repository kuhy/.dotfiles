** Music visualizer
   Set visualizer data source:
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
   visualizer_data_source = localhost:5555
   #+END_SRC
   Note: Below parameter is needed for =ncmpcpp= to determine which output
   provides data for visualizer and thus allow syncing between visualization and
   sound as currently there are some problems with it.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
   visualizer_output_name = Visualizer feed
   #+END_SRC
   If you set format to =44100:16:2=, make it 'yes'.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
   visualizer_in_stereo = yes
   #+END_SRC
   Note: To enable spectrum frequency visualization you need to compile =ncmpcpp=
   with =fftw3= support.
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
   visualizer_type = spectrum
   visualizer_look = +|
   visualizer_spectrum_smooth_look = no
   #+END_SRC

  Make =ncmpcpp= more vim-like.
